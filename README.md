**Author**: Raven Delaney
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Intro to using a sentiment classifier for machine learning

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
If running through VS code, you need command line, vs code, and python 3
After opening the files in a shell enviornment, install pandas, numpy, and tensorflow so the notebook will run properly
Also viewable online

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
I chose a dataset that has hotel reviews and a corresponding number for ratings.
For each rating number, I attached a sentiment classifier. 4 and 5 are given a 2, 3 is given a 1, and 2 or 1 are given a 0.

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
